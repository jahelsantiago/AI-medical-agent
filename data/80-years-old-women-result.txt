An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital
because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral-
blood smear.
Six weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after
4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid
foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had grad-
ually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point
that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to
another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had
lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was
38.9Â°C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed
pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes.
Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-
function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Imaging studies were obtained.
A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography
(CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous
and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in
the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in
diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side

On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g
per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastro-
duodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates
throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent
with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated.

Based on the information provided, here are my diagnoses:

-Syndromic Diagnosis: The patient is presenting with a syndrome of pancytopenia and schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, along with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, fever, dysphagia, early satiety, fatigue, light-headedness, and weight loss. This could be indicative of a systemic infection or malignancy. 
Differential diagnoses: 
1. Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome: This condition can cause similar symptoms and lab findings, including pancytopenia and schistocytes.
2. Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: This is another condition that can cause similar symptoms and lab findings.

-Topographic Diagnosis: The patient has esophageal inflammation with white exudates and yeast consistent with candida found in brushings. This suggests an infection in the esophagus. 
Differential diagnoses: 
1. Gastric malignancy: The presence of indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses could suggest a malignancy that has metastasized.
2. Hiatal hernia: This condition could potentially cause some of the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.

-Etiological Diagnosis: The patient has a Candida infection in the esophagus. This is a type of fungal infection that can cause the symptoms the patient is experiencing. 
Differential diagnoses: 
1. Bacterial infection: While the presence of Candida has been confirmed, it's possible that there could also be a bacterial infection present.
2. Viral infection: Similarly, a viral infection could also be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

I agree with your syndromic diagnosis and the differential diagnoses you've provided. However, I would like to add Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) to the list. The presence of schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells, along with pancytopenia, could suggest a coagulation disorder like DIC. This condition can occur due to sepsis, malignancy, or trauma, and can lead to systemic symptoms like fatigue, light-headedness, and fever.

Regarding the topographic diagnosis, I concur with your assessment of esophageal candidiasis. However, I would like to point out that the presence of candida in the esophagus could also be a sign of an immunocompromised state, which could be due to an underlying malignancy or infection. The presence of indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses further supports this possibility.

As for the etiological diagnosis, while Candida infection is a likely cause, we should also consider other opportunistic infections that can occur in immunocompromised patients. These could include cytomegalovirus (CMV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV) esophagitis. Furthermore, the presence of systemic symptoms and pancytopenia could suggest a systemic infection like sepsis.

In conclusion, while Candida esophagitis is a likely diagnosis, we should also consider the possibility of an underlying immunocompromised state due to malignancy or systemic infection. Further investigations, including a biopsy of the pelvic masses and blood cultures, should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

[33mInfectionist-microbiologist[0m (to chat_manager):

The possible microorganisms that may affect the patient are:

1. Candida species: The patient's esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed yeast consistent with Candida, indicating a Candida infection. Candida is a type of fungus that can cause infections in various parts of the body, including the esophagus.

2. Bacteria: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, and fever could be indicative of a bacterial infection. However, specific bacteria cannot be identified without further testing.

3. Viruses: The patient's systemic symptoms could also be due to a viral infection. Again, specific viruses cannot be identified without further testing.

Elements in the anamnesis that support microorganisms as the cause of the diseases:

1. The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, and fever suggest an infectious cause.

2. The presence of yeast consistent with Candida in the esophagus indicates a fungal infection.

3. The patient's pancytopenia could be due to a systemic infection.

4. The patient's progressive fatigue and light-headedness could be due to the body's response to an infection.

Based on the above information, the microorganism that has the most elements supporting it as the cause of the patient's condition is Candida. Therefore, the patient's diagnosis is likely Candida esophagitis. However, further testing should be done to rule out other possible infections and to confirm the diagnosis.

The final diagnosis is Candida Esophagitis.

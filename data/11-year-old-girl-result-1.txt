    An 11-year-old girl was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital because of redness of the eyes.The patient had been well until 8 weeks before the current evaluation, when she noticed mild eye redness, which was worse in the right eye than in the left eye. There was intermittent swelling of the eyelids but no photophobia, itching, pain, tearing,or discharge. The patient‚Äôs parents administered naphazoline hydrochloride and glycerin eye drops, but the eye redness did not abate. When the eye redness had persisted for 2 weeks, the patient was taken to the pediatrics clinic of another hospital. She was given a 7-day course of an oral antibiotic agent as empirical treatment for possible preseptal cellulitis.Five weeks before the current evaluation, the eye redness persisted despite treatment, and the patient was referred to the ophthalmology clinic of the other hospital.The blood pressure was not measured during this evaluation. The visual acuity with correction was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The pupils were symmetric and reactive to light, with no relative afferent pupillary defect. Slit-lamp examination revealed abundant white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes,with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were also keratic precipitates, posterior synechiae, and rare iris nodules in the right eye. Funduscopic examination was notable for optic-disk swelling and peripheral retinal hemorrhages in both eyes, as well as perivascular exudates in the right eye. Cyclopentolate eyedrops in the right eye and prednisolone eye drops in both eyes were prescribed.During the subsequent 3 weeks, additional tests were performed in the pediatric clinic of the other hospital. Screening blood tests for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, syphilis, and Lyme disease were negative. An interferon-Œ≥release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was indeterminate. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Radiography of the chest revealed hilar fullness.Dr. Maria G. Figueiro Longo: Computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast mate-rial, showed a normal-appearing thymus. However, diffuse lymphadenopathy was detected in the mediastinum, upper abdomen, and axillae, with the largest lymph node measuring 2.0 cm by 1.3 cm by 1.8 cm.

Two weeks before the current evaluation, the patient presented to the emergency department of the other hospital for an expedited workup. On evaluation, she described eye redness that had persisted but decreased in severity. She reported no fever, weight loss, night sweats, rash, headache, cough, shortness of breath,or joint pain. On examination, the temperaturewas 37.0¬∞C, the blood pressure 96/61 mm Hg, the heart rate 95 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 100% while she was breathing ambient air.The body-mass index was 18.3.

The patient appeared well, with no oral lesions or rash. The visual acuity was unchanged.Slit-lamp examination revealed keratic precipi-tates and white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes, with a greater amount in the right eye than in the left eye. There were extensive poste-rior synechiae in the right eye. 
Funduscopic examination showed vitreous white cells,optic-disk swelling, perivascular exudates, peripheral retinal hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots in both eyes. The lungs were clear on auscultation.
Urinalysis was normal.. Methylprednisolone Was administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital.During the next 4 days, additional tests were performed, and sputum specimens were obtained for an acid-fast bacilli smear and culture. Optical Coherence tomography revealed optic-disk swell-ing but no cystoid macular swelling. Fluoresceinangiography revealed optic-disk leakage with areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion and some vessel leakage.

she had emigrated from West Africa To the United States 6 years earlier; since then, she had lived with her mother and father in a suburban town in New England and had not traveled outside the region. Six months before this evaluation, an interferon-Œ≥ release assay for M. tuberculosis had been positive. At that time, the patient had received a prescription for a medication to treat latent tuberculosis infection; however, the pa-tient‚Äôs parents could not recall giving the medica-tion to the patient. She was taking the prescribed cyclopentolate and prednisolone eye drops, oral prednisone, and regimen of rifampin, isoniazid,ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. There were no known drug allergies.

One year after the patient was evaluated in the rheumatology clinic of this hospital and 3 months after she completed a 9-month course of medication for possible tuberculosis, a ‚Äúwobbly‚Äùgait developed while she was receiving therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (1500 mg per day) On examination during the video call, the patient was observed to have a bilateral Trendelenburg Gait. She could not stand on one leg, stand on her toes, or squat. She was instructed to present to the emergency department of this hospital.In the emergency department, the patient described aching pain in the lower back and both hips and weakness in the lower legs that had.

On examination, she appeared well.There was profound weakness on eversion of theright ankle, dorsiflexion of both ankles, and flex-ion of the left knee and both hips. Strength andreflexes in the arms were normal, as was sensationin response to light touch, pain, temperature,and vibration. Results of finger-to-nose testingwere normal; the Romberg sign and the Babinskireflex were absent. There was a wide-based gait,and the right foot dragged more than the left foot.
An MRI of the lumbar spine performed before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material,revealed an enhancing, T2-hyperintense intramedullary lesion in the lower thoracic spinal cord and conus medullaris. There was also smooth thickening and enhancement of the cauda equina nerve roots. MRI of the head performed
before and after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed prominence of the lacrimal glands.

Based on the information provided, here are my diagnostic considerations:

Syndromic Diagnosis:
1. Uveitis: The patient's persistent eye redness, swelling of the eyelids, and the presence of white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes suggest inflammation of the uvea, known as uveitis.
Differential diagnoses:
   - Conjunctivitis: This condition could also cause redness and swelling, but it's usually accompanied by itching, tearing, and discharge, which the patient doesn't have.
   - Keratitis: Inflammation of the cornea could also cause redness and discomfort, but it's typically associated with pain and photophobia, which the patient doesn't report.

Topographic Diagnosis:
1. Eyes: The patient's symptoms and findings on slit-lamp and funduscopic examination point to a problem in the eyes.
Differential diagnoses:
   - Central nervous system: Given the patient's later development of a "wobbly" gait and weakness in the lower legs, there could be involvement of the central nervous system.
   - Lymphatic system: The patient's chest CT showing diffuse lymphadenopathy suggests possible involvement of the lymphatic system.

Etiological Diagnosis:
1. Tuberculosis (TB): The patient's positive interferon-Œ≥ release assay for M. tuberculosis, history of treatment for latent TB infection, and the presence of hilar fullness on chest radiography suggest TB as a possible cause. TB can cause uveitis and neurologic symptoms.
Differential diagnoses:
   - Sarcoidosis: This systemic granulomatous disease can cause uveitis and lymphadenopathy, and it's more common in people of African descent.
   - Lyme disease: Although the patient's screening test was negative, Lyme disease can cause uveitis and neurologic symptoms. However, it's less likely given the patient's lack of travel history and absence of other typical symptoms like rash and joint pain.

I agree with your syndromic and topographic diagnoses, but I would like to challenge your etiological diagnosis. While tuberculosis is a possibility, the patient's symptoms and test results also align with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ, but most commonly affects the lungs and lymph nodes. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells. The disease can cause a wide range of symptoms, depending on which organs are affected.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of uveitis, lymphadenopathy, and neurological symptoms could all be explained by sarcoidosis. Uveitis is a common manifestation of sarcoidosis, and can cause redness, pain, and vision problems. The patient's CT scan showed diffuse lymphadenopathy, another common feature of sarcoidosis. Neurosarcoidosis, which affects the nervous system, could explain the patient's "wobbly" gait and weakness in the lower legs.

Furthermore, the patient's lab results showed elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, which is often seen in sarcoidosis. The patient's negative tests for HIV, syphilis, and Lyme disease also support a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, as these conditions can cause similar symptoms but were ruled out.

While the patient's positive interferon-Œ≥ release assay for M. tuberculosis suggests a possible TB infection, it's important to note that this test can produce false positives, especially in people who have been vaccinated with the BCG vaccine, which is common in many parts of Africa. The patient's parents also could not recall giving the patient medication for latent TB infection, suggesting that she may not have been adequately treated for TB.

In conclusion, while TB is a possibility, I believe that sarcoidosis is a more likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms, test results, and history.

[33mInfectionist-microbiologist[0m (to chat_manager):

Possible microorganisms that may affect the patient:

1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis: The patient had a positive interferon-Œ≥ release assay for M. tuberculosis six months before the current evaluation. This bacterium causes tuberculosis, which can manifest in various forms, including ocular tuberculosis and neurotuberculosis.

2. Borrelia burgdorferi: This bacterium causes Lyme disease, which can cause uveitis and neurologic symptoms. However, the patient's screening test for Lyme disease was negative.

3. Treponema pallidum: This bacterium causes syphilis, which can also cause uveitis and neurologic symptoms. However, the patient's screening test for syphilis was negative.

4. HIV: This virus can cause a wide range of symptoms, including uveitis and neurologic symptoms. However, the patient's screening test for HIV was negative.

Elements in anamnesis that support microorganisms as the cause of the diseases:

1. The patient's positive interferon-Œ≥ release assay for M. tuberculosis suggests a possible TB infection.

2. The patient's persistent eye redness and the presence of white cells in the anterior chamber of both eyes suggest an infectious cause.

3. The patient's later development of a "wobbly" gait and weakness in the lower legs suggest possible neurologic involvement, which can occur in some infectious diseases.

4. The patient's chest CT showing diffuse lymphadenopathy suggests possible systemic infection.

5. The patient's history of emigration from West Africa could suggest exposure to certain infectious diseases that are more common in that region.

Microorganisms that have more elements as the diagnosis:

Based on the information provided, Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the most likely microorganism causing the patient's symptoms. The patient had a positive interferon-Œ≥ release assay for M. tuberculosis, and her symptoms of uveitis and neurologic symptoms can be caused by this bacterium. Furthermore, the patient's history of emigration from West Africa, where TB is more prevalent, supports this diagnosis.

[33mConcluder[0m (to chat_manager):

The final diagnosis is Neurosarcoidosis.

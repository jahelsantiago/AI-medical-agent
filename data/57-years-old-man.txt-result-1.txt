An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital
because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral-
blood smear.
Six weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after
4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid
foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had grad-
ually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point
that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to
another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had
lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was
38.9Â°C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed
pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes.
Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-
function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Imaging studies were obtained.
A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography
(CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous
and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in
the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in
diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side

On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g
per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastro-
duodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates
throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent
with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated.
 During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent feverand limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of con-cerns about a possible tick borne illness.On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest,performed after the administration of intrave-nous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening,findings consistent with pulmonary edema,along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intrave-nous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided.On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancyto-penia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets,and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombsâ€™ tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosisand anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes,glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests forEpsteinâ€“Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells;there was an increased amount of atypicalCD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance.A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible throm-botic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Totalparenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia.On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocar-diogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there is trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Onhospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care.On evaluation in this hospital, the patientreported that her energy level had increased. Sherecalled that she had felt mildly confused at theother hospital, but the confusion had since re-solved. She had had no gum bleeding or bloodin the stool or urine. Other medical history in-cluded hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgicalhistory included hysterectomy at 40 years of age,with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure.One year earlier, routine laboratory testinghad revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia.A bone marrow biopsy performed at that timehad revealed slightly hypercellular marrow withmaturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with someerythroid abnormalities and occasional hyper-chromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysishad shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and again of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. There-after, blood counts monitored every 4 months,including 4 months before this presentation,had remained stable; laboratory test results areshown in Table 1.Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin,and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no knowndrug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occa-sionally and did not use illicit drugs. She hadsmoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 yearsbefore this presentation. She was widowed andlived alone in New England; her work involvedcleaning a church several days a week.

Based on the information provided, here are my diagnoses:

Syndromic Diagnosis:
1. Primary: Hematologic syndrome (pancytopenia, schistocytes)
2. Differential: Infectious syndrome (fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea)
3. Differential: Respiratory syndrome (decreased oxygen saturation, ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening on CT)

Topographic Diagnosis:
1. Primary: Bone marrow (pancytopenia, schistocytes, previous bone marrow biopsy showing abnormalities)
2. Differential: Esophagus (dysphagia, esophageal inflammation with white exudates, candida found in brushings)
3. Differential: Lungs (decreased oxygen saturation, ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening on CT)

Etiological Diagnosis:
1. Primary: Myelodysplastic syndrome (history of bone marrow biopsy showing abnormalities, cytogenetic analysis showing loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and gain of chromosome 8, persistent pancytopenia)
2. Differential: Candida esophagitis (esophageal inflammation with white exudates, candida found in brushings)
3. Differential: Unknown tick-borne illness (history of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, empirical therapy with doxycycline initiated)

The patient's hematologic syndrome is likely due to myelodysplastic syndrome, given her history and the findings on previous bone marrow biopsy. The esophageal symptoms and findings are likely due to Candida esophagitis, which is being treated with fluconazole. The cause of her initial symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea is unclear, but a tick-borne illness was considered and empirical therapy with doxycycline was started. The cause of her respiratory symptoms and findings is also unclear, but may be related to fluid overload, given the improvement with cessation of intravenous fluids and administration of furosemide.

I agree with your syndromic and topographic diagnoses, but I would like to propose a different etiological diagnosis. 

Given the patient's age, history of pancytopenia, and the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear, I would consider Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) as a primary diagnosis. TTP is a rare blood disorder characterized by clotting in small blood vessels, resulting in a low platelet count. The presence of schistocytes, which are fragmented red blood cells, is a classic sign of TTP. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, lightheadedness, and confusion could be attributed to TTP, as it can cause a decrease in the number of red blood cells (anemia) and impact brain function.

The patient's esophageal symptoms and the presence of Candida in brushings indeed suggest Candida esophagitis. However, it's important to note that Candida infections are often opportunistic, occurring when the immune system is compromised. In this case, the patient's immune system could be compromised due to TTP or myelodysplastic syndrome.

The patient's respiratory symptoms and the CT findings could be due to a number of causes, including infection, fluid overload, or even a pulmonary embolism secondary to TTP. 

In conclusion, while myelodysplastic syndrome could be a potential cause of the patient's symptoms, I believe TTP should be considered as a primary diagnosis given the presence of schistocytes and the patient's clinical presentation. Further diagnostic tests, such as ADAMTS13 activity, could help confirm this diagnosis.

[33mInfectionist-microbiologist[0m (to chat_manager):

Possible microorganisms that may affect the patient:

1. Candida species: The patient has esophageal inflammation with white exudates and brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida. This is supported by the patient's symptoms of dysphagia and odynophagia.

2. Unknown tick-borne pathogen: The patient was started on empirical therapy with doxycycline due to concerns about a possible tick-borne illness. This is supported by the patient's initial symptoms of fever, chills, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

3. Unknown respiratory pathogen: The patient's CT of the chest revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, which could be indicative of a respiratory infection. This is supported by the patient's decreased oxygen saturation.

Based on the elements in the anamnesis that support microorganisms as the cause of the diseases, Candida species is the most likely microorganism causing the patient's symptoms. The patient's esophageal symptoms and the presence of candida in brushings strongly suggest Candida esophagitis. The patient's other symptoms could be due to other underlying conditions, such as Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) or myelodysplastic syndrome, as suggested by the other physicians.

[33mConcluder[0m (to chat_manager):

The final diagnosis for the patient is Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) with concurrent Candida Esophagitis.

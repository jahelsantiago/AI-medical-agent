    A 14-year-old boy was admitted to this hospital be cause of fatigue, fever, joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea.The patient had been well until 2 weeks before this admission, when fatigue and fever developed on his final day of summer camp. He was taken to the pri-mary care clinic at another hospital and was told that he had a viral infection.Nine days before this admission, new mild sore throat developed, and the pa-tient returned to the primary care clinic. A throat culture for group A beta-hemo-lytic streptococcus was reportedly negative. The patient was told that he had pos-sible sinusitis, and treatment with amoxicillinâ€“clavulanate was started. During the next 3 days, the sore throat abated, but fatigue and fever persisted.Six days before this admission, new pain in the right shoulder and left kneedeveloped, and the patient again returned to the primary care clinic. The white-cellcount and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were reportedly elevated; a blood test forLyme disease was performed.On the day of admission, the joint pain progressed to involve the shoulders and knees on both sides, and the temperature increased to 39.4Â°C. The patient was given ibuprofen and brought to the emergency department at this hospital. Onevaluation, the patient described aching pain in the shoulders and knees, which was worst in his right shoulder and left knee. He rated the pain at 7 on a scale of0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. He had not noticed redness,swelling, or stiffness of the joints. A review of systems was notable for chills,intermittent night sweats, headache, myalgias, and lightheadedness when he stood up from a sitting position. He had no weight loss, rash, vision changes, or respira-tory symptoms. He had mild abdominal cramping, decreased appetite, and intermittent nausea. During the past week, there had been a few episodes of nonbloody emesis and watery diarrhea. There had been no hematemesis, hematochezia, ormelena.The patient had autism spectrum disorder, with an early delay in speech development that had resolved after speech therapy. He had met milestones for gross

    and fine motor skills and growth. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccina-tions. Other history included asthma, seasonal rhinosinusitis, and allergies to peanuts and treenuts; there were no known drug allergies. He had undergone a tonsillectomy in early child-hood. Medications included amoxicillinâ€“clavula-nate, inhaled fluticasone, and ibuprofen and inhaled albuterol as needed.At the time of admission, the patient was on his summer break before entering high school.Earlier in the summer, he had gone on vacation to a coastal area of New England. He had also attended camp in a rural area of New England,where he camped and hiked in wooded areas and swam in fresh water. He had seen a tick on his clothing but did not recall any bites. Two Weeks before this admission, the patient had returned to his home in a suburban area of NewEngland, where he lived with his mother (who was a veterinarian), father, sister, and pet dog.His sister had recently had an acute gastrointes-tinal illness that resolved after several days. Thepatient was not sexually active and did not use alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. His mother had hypo-thyroidism, and his maternal uncle had rheuma-toid arthritis; there was no other known family history of autoimmune diseases.On examination, the temperature was 36.1Â°C,the blood pressure 128/58 mm Hg, the heart rate107 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation97% while the patient was breathing ambientair. The body-mass index (the weight in kilo-grams divided by the square of the height in meters) was 27.2. The patient appeared to be well developed and well nourished, but he looked tired. The conjunctivae were normal. The mucous membranes were dry, and there was an aphthous ulcer on the right buccal mucosa. The lungs were clear on auscultation. There was tenderness on palpation of the epigastric and periumbilical abdomen. There was no erythema, warmth,swelling, or crepitus of the large and small joints. There was tenderness on palpation, as well as pain with movement, of the right shoulder and knees; range of motion in these joints was not decreased. The patient had no rash or lymph-adenopathy.The white-cell count was 12,950 per microliter (reference range, 4500 to 13,000), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate 48 mm per hour (ref-erence range, 0 to 13), the C-reactive protein level 207.6 mg per liter (reference range, 0.0 to8.0), and the lipase level 82 U per liter (reference range, 13 to 60). Laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.While the patient was in the emergency department, the temperature increased to 39.2Â°C.Intravenous fluids were administered, and em-pirical treatment with doxycycline was started.The patient was admitted to the hospital.During the next 2 days, the fever resolved, but the joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diar-rhea worsened in severity. On the third hospital day, fever recurred. The white-cell count was 15,190 per microliter, the C-reactive protein level 178.3 mg per liter, and the lipase level 145 U per liter. A fecal occult blood test was positive. A plain film of the right shoulder was normal.

Based on the patient's symptoms and history, here are my initial diagnoses:

- Syndromic Diagnosis: The patient is presenting with a febrile illness accompanied by joint pain, abdominal cramping, and diarrhea. The primary syndrome could be Infectious Arthritis. Differential diagnoses could be Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) or Rheumatic Fever.

- Topographic Diagnosis: The primary topographic diagnosis could be the Gastrointestinal Tract and Joints. Differential diagnoses could be the Musculoskeletal System or the Cardiovascular System.

- Etiological Diagnosis: Given the patient's history of camping in a rural area and the presence of a tick on his clothing, the primary etiological diagnosis could be Lyme Disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Differential diagnoses could be a viral infection (such as Epstein-Barr virus) or a bacterial infection (such as Streptococcus).

Further diagnostic tests, including serological tests for Lyme disease, would be necessary to confirm these diagnoses.

I agree with your syndromic and topographic diagnoses, but I would like to propose a different etiological diagnosis. Given the patient's symptoms, history, and lab results, I believe the patient may be suffering from Campylobacter jejuni infection.

Campylobacter jejuni is a common cause of gastroenteritis, which aligns with the patient's symptoms of abdominal cramping and diarrhea. This bacterium is often found in undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and contaminated water, which the patient may have been exposed to during his camping trip.

Moreover, Campylobacter jejuni infection can lead to reactive arthritis, which could explain the patient's joint pain. Reactive arthritis is a type of inflammatory arthritis that develops in response to an infection in another part of the body, in this case, the gastrointestinal tract.

The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level also support this diagnosis, as they indicate an ongoing inflammatory response, which is common in Campylobacter jejuni infection.

To confirm this diagnosis, a stool culture test for Campylobacter jejuni should be performed. If the test comes back positive, the patient should be treated with antibiotics such as azithromycin or erythromycin.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest several possible infectious agents:

1. Borrelia burgdorferi: This bacterium causes Lyme disease, which can present with fever, fatigue, and joint pain. The patient's history of camping in a wooded area and finding a tick on his clothing supports this possibility.

2. Campylobacter jejuni: This bacterium can cause gastroenteritis, presenting with abdominal cramping and diarrhea. It can also lead to reactive arthritis, which could explain the patient's joint pain. The patient's history of camping and possible exposure to contaminated water or food supports this possibility.

3. Epstein-Barr virus: This virus can cause infectious mononucleosis, which can present with fatigue, fever, and sore throat. The patient's initial symptoms and the negative test for streptococcus in the throat culture could support this possibility.

4. Streptococcus: Although the throat culture was negative, it's still possible that a streptococcal infection could be causing the patient's symptoms. Some strains can cause joint pain and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Elements in the anamnesis that support microorganisms as the cause of the diseases include the patient's history of camping in a wooded area, finding a tick on his clothing, and the onset of symptoms after returning from camp.

Given the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is either Lyme disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi or a Campylobacter jejuni infection. Further testing, including a blood test for Lyme disease and a stool culture for Campylobacter, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

I appreciate the perspectives provided by my colleagues. However, I would like to propose a different etiological diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms, history, and lab results. I believe the patient may be suffering from a systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA), which is an autoimmune disease.

sJIA is characterized by arthritis, fever, and rash, and it can also cause abdominal pain and diarrhea. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, fever, joint pain, and gastrointestinal symptoms could be explained by this diagnosis. The elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level are also consistent with sJIA, as they indicate an ongoing inflammatory response.

The patient's history of asthma and allergies, as well as the family history of autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis in a maternal uncle), could suggest a predisposition to autoimmune conditions. Furthermore, the patient's age is consistent with the typical age of onset for sJIA.

To confirm this diagnosis, further tests could be performed, including a complete blood count, liver function tests, and tests for rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies. If the diagnosis of sJIA is confirmed, treatment would typically involve nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

While it's important to consider infectious causes given the patient's history, we should not overlook the possibility of an autoimmune condition, especially given the patient's symptoms and lab results.

    A 19-year-old man was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) of this hospital because of shock, multiple organ failure,and rash.The patient had been well until 20 hours before this admission, when diffuse abdominal pain and nausea developed after he ate rice, chicken, and lo mein left-overs from a restaurant meal. Multiple episodes of emesis occurred, with vomitus that was either bilious or red-brown. The abdominal pain and vomiting were fol-lowed by the development of chills, generalized weakness, progressively worsening diffuse myalgias, chest pain, shortness of breath, headache, neck stiffness, and blurry vision. Five hours before this admission, purplish discoloration of the skin developed, and a friend took the patient to the emergency department of another hospital for evaluation.On arrival at the emergency department of the other hospital, 4.5 hours before this admission, the patient reported diffuse myalgias that he rated at 8 on a scale of 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the most severe pain. On examination, he appeared pale, anxious, and moderately distressed; he answered questions appropriately and was oriented to person, place, time, and situation. The temperature was 37.4Â°C, the pulse 147 beats per minute, the blood pressure 154/124 mm Hg, the respiratory rate24 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while he was breathing ambient air. The oral mucous membranes were dry. On auscultation of the heart,tachycardia was present with a regular rhythm. The radial pulses were normal. Thelungs were clear, without crackles, rhonchi, or wheezes. The abdomen was soft and nondistended, without tenderness; the patient vomited yellow-green material dur-ing the examination. The skin was warm and dry and had a mottled appearance.Blood specimens were obtained and sent to the laboratory for culture, a com-plete blood count, and tests of renal function, liver function, and coagulation, as well as measurement of levels of electrolytes, glucose, lipase, lactic acid, and troponin.

A urine specimen was sent for urinalysis and culture, and a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained for influenza virus nucleic acid testing. Approxi-mately 40 minutes after the patientâ€™s arrival at the other hospital, ondansetron, ceftriaxone, and a 2-liter bolus of 0.90% normal saline were ad-ministered intravenously.During the next 30 minutes, tachypnea wors-ened and labored breathing, hypoxemia, andcyanosis developed. Supplemental oxygen was administered through a nonrebreather face mask,resulting in an oxygen saturation of 83%; then,oxygen was administered through a high-flow nasal cannula at a rate of 40 liters per minute.Intravenous doses of dexamethasone and vanco-mycin were given.During the following 40 minutes, the systolic blood pressure fell to 70 mm Hg and the dorsa-lis pedis pulses were noted to be weak. Approxi-mately 110 minutes after the patientâ€™s arrival atthe other hospital, a triple-lumen central venous catheter was placed in the right femoral vein anda continuous intravenous infusion of norepineph-rine was initiated. After intravenous doses of midazolam, etomidate, and fentanyl were ad-ministered, tracheal intubation was performedand mechanical ventilation with pressure-regu-lated volume control was begun, with a tidalvolume of 6 ml per kilogram of body weight, arate of 24 breaths per minute, a positive end-expiratory pressure of 10 cm of water, and a frac-tion of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of 100%. A con-tinuous infusion of propofol was begun.Hypotension persisted, and a diffuse purpu-ric rash developed. Approximately 2 hours after the patientâ€™s arrival at the other hospital, a dose of piperacillinâ€“tazobactam was administered, a1-liter bolus of 0.45% normal saline with 150 meq of sodium bicarbonate was given, and a Foleycatheter was inserted. Twenty minutes later, a continuous intravenous infusion of phenyleph-rine was added, followed 7 minutes later by a vasopressin infusion. The patient was trans-ported by helicopter to the PICU of this hospital.On the patientâ€™s admission to this hospital,additional history was obtained from family members. A friend who had eaten the same meal as the patient the evening before admission had vomited once shortly thereafter but had not become progressively ill. The patient had a history of anxiety and depression, as well as intermit-tent ear infections during childhood. He had no known drug allergies. He had reportedly received all routine childhood vaccinations. He smoked two packs of cigarettes weekly, smokedmarijuana daily, and drank two alcoholic bever-ages approximately 2 times per week. He used dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine recreationally but did not use other illicit drugs.The patient lived in northern New England with his mother, brother, and three cats but had been staying with a friend for 5 days before ad-mission, during which time he had visited a beach along the ocean and a music venue. Heworked part-time at a restaurant; he had not traveled recently or had any other exposure to animals or ill persons. His father had coronary artery disease, his mother had hypothyroidism,and his brother had had viral meningitis at6 weeks of age.On examination, the patient was pharmacologically sedated. The temperature was 40.8Â°C,the pulse 166 beats per minute, the blood pres-sure 120/53 mm Hg, the respiratory rate 28 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 95%while he was receiving mechanical ventilation with an Fio2 of 50%. He opened his eyes occa-sionally. The pupils were equal and reactive to light. The femoral pulses were palpable, but the peripheral pulses were not palpable and the digits were cold. There was diffuse anasarca and ooz-ing from venipuncture sites and from the site of central venous catheter insertion. A diffuse reticular purpuric rash was present on the face,chest, abdomen, back, arms, and legs, sparing the palms and soles. A Foley catheter was in place, without urine output. Laboratory Test results are shown in Table 1. Chest radiog-raphy revealed perihilar airspace and diffuse interstitial opacities and bilateral small, layering pleural effusions

 A transthoracic echo-cardiogram was obtained while the patient was receiving norepinephrine, epinephrine, and vaso-pressin. The left ventricle had moderate dysfunc-tion with regional wall-motion abnormalities;septal motion was decreased, but apical motion appeared to be preserved. The right ventricle had mild-to-moderate dysfunction with underfilling.There was no pericardial effusion.
 Approximately 7 hours after admis-sion to this hospital, a diagnostic test result was received and additional management decisions were made.

Based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, here are my diagnoses:

Syndromic Diagnosis:
1. Septic Shock: The patient's symptoms of fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and organ dysfunction are indicative of septic shock.
Differential Diagnoses:
2. Toxic Shock Syndrome: The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and multiple organ failure could also suggest toxic shock syndrome.
3. Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC): The patient's abnormal coagulation profile, thrombocytopenia, and bleeding from venipuncture sites suggest DIC.

Topographic Diagnosis:
1. Systemic Infection: The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest a systemic infection affecting multiple organ systems.
Differential Diagnoses:
2. Gastrointestinal Infection: The patient's initial symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting suggest a possible gastrointestinal infection.
3. Respiratory Infection: The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, tachypnea, and hypoxemia could suggest a respiratory infection.

Etiological Diagnosis:
1. Gram-Negative Bacterial Infection: The patient's symptoms and lab results, including elevated neutrophils and lactic acid, suggest a gram-negative bacterial infection.
Differential Diagnoses:
2. Staphylococcus aureus Infection: If the patient has toxic shock syndrome, it could be caused by a Staphylococcus aureus infection.
3. Streptococcus pneumoniae Infection: If the patient has a respiratory infection, it could be caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Further diagnostic tests, including blood cultures and gram stain, would be helpful in confirming the etiological diagnosis. The patient should be managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation, and supportive care for organ dysfunction.

[33mselfish_infectologist[0m (to chat_manager):

I agree with your syndromic and topographic diagnoses, but I would like to propose a different etiological diagnosis. Given the patient's history of consuming leftover food from a restaurant, the sudden onset of symptoms, and the rapid progression of the disease, I would consider Bacillus cereus food poisoning as a possible cause. 

Bacillus cereus is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium commonly associated with food poisoning. It produces toxins that can cause two types of illness: diarrheal and emetic (vomiting). The emetic type is often caused by consuming contaminated rice, pasta, or other starchy foods, which aligns with the patient's history. 

The rapid onset of symptoms (within 1-6 hours after consumption of contaminated food) and the severity of the patient's condition could be explained by the ingestion of a large amount of preformed cereulide toxin in the food. This toxin is heat-stable and can survive cooking temperatures, which is why it's often associated with leftover or inadequately reheated food.

Moreover, Bacillus cereus has been associated with non-gastrointestinal infections, including severe systemic and cutaneous infections. This could explain the patient's symptoms of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash. 

The patient's lab results, including leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated lactic acid, and abnormal coagulation profile, are consistent with severe sepsis or septic shock, which can occur in severe Bacillus cereus infections.

Therefore, I would recommend obtaining blood cultures and testing for Bacillus cereus. The patient should be treated with high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotics, including vancomycin and gentamicin, which are effective against Bacillus cereus. Supportive care for shock and organ dysfunction should also be continued.

[33mInfectionist-microbiologist[0m (to chat_manager):

The patient's symptoms and history indeed suggest a severe systemic infection. The rapid onset of symptoms after consuming leftover food, along with the severe gastrointestinal symptoms, point towards a foodborne illness. 

Possible microorganisms that may affect the patient include:

1. Bacillus cereus: This bacterium is commonly associated with food poisoning, especially in foods like rice that have been left at room temperature. It can produce toxins that cause vomiting and diarrhea. 

2. Staphylococcus aureus: This bacterium can also cause food poisoning, resulting in similar symptoms to Bacillus cereus. It is often associated with improperly stored meats and dairy products.

3. Clostridium perfringens: This bacterium is another common cause of food poisoning, especially in meat and poultry that has been cooked and left to cool slowly.

4. Escherichia coli: Certain strains of this bacterium can cause severe food poisoning, resulting in severe abdominal pain and diarrhea.

Elements in the anamnesis that support microorganisms as the cause of the diseases include:

1. The patient's consumption of leftover food: This increases the risk of foodborne illnesses caused by bacteria like Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Clostridium perfringens.

2. The rapid onset of symptoms: This is characteristic of foodborne illnesses, which often cause symptoms to appear within a few hours of consuming contaminated food.

3. The severe gastrointestinal symptoms: These are common symptoms of foodborne illnesses.

4. The progression to shock and multiple organ failure: This suggests a severe systemic infection, which can occur in severe cases of foodborne illness.

Given these factors, Bacillus cereus seems to be the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms. This bacterium is commonly associated with leftover rice, which the patient consumed, and can cause severe systemic infections. Therefore, I would diagnose the patient with a Bacillus cereus infection.

[33mOncologist[0m (to chat_manager):

I agree with the previous assessments that this patient is likely suffering from a severe systemic infection, and the rapid onset of symptoms after consuming leftover food does suggest a foodborne illness. However, I would like to propose another possible etiological diagnosis: Clostridium perfringens.

Clostridium perfringens is a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium that is one of the most common causes of food poisoning. It produces a toxin that can cause severe abdominal cramps and diarrhea. The symptoms usually occur within 6 to 24 hours after consuming contaminated food, which aligns with the patient's history.

Moreover, Clostridium perfringens has been associated with non-gastrointestinal infections, including gas gangrene and sepsis. This could explain the patient's symptoms of shock, multiple organ failure, and rash. 

The patient's lab results, including leukocytosis with a left shift, elevated lactic acid, and abnormal coagulation profile, are consistent with severe sepsis or septic shock, which can occur in severe Clostridium perfringens infections.

Therefore, I would recommend obtaining blood cultures and testing for Clostridium perfringens. The patient should be treated with high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotics, including penicillin and clindamycin, which are effective against Clostridium perfringens. Supportive care for shock and organ dysfunction should also be continued.

[33mConcluder[0m (to chat_manager):

The patient is suffering from severe sepsis and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) likely due to a Bacillus cereus infection.

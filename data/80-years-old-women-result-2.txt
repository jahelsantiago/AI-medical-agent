An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital
because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral-
blood smear.
Six weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after
4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid
foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had grad-
ually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point
that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to
another hospital for evaluation.
At the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had
lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was
38.9°C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms
divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed
pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes.
Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-
function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.
Imaging studies were obtained.
A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography
(CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous
and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in
the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in
diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side

On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g
per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastro-
duodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates
throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent
with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated.
 During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent feverand limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of con-cerns about a possible tick borne illness.On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest,performed after the administration of intrave-nous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening,findings consistent with pulmonary edema,along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intrave-nous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided.On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancyto-penia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets,and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombs’ tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosisand anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes,glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests forEpstein–Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells;there was an increased amount of atypicalCD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance.A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible throm-botic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Totalparenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia.On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocar-diogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there is trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Onhospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care.On evaluation in this hospital, the patientreported that her energy level had increased. Sherecalled that she had felt mildly confused at theother hospital, but the confusion had since re-solved. She had had no gum bleeding or bloodin the stool or urine. Other medical history in-cluded hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgicalhistory included hysterectomy at 40 years of age,with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure.One year earlier, routine laboratory testinghad revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia.A bone marrow biopsy performed at that timehad revealed slightly hypercellular marrow withmaturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with someerythroid abnormalities and occasional hyper-chromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysishad shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and again of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. There-after, blood counts monitored every 4 months,including 4 months before this presentation,had remained stable; laboratory test results areshown in Table 1.Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin,and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no knowndrug allergies.

-Syndromic Diagnosis: The patient is presenting with a syndrome of pancytopenia, fatigue, weight loss, fever, and dysphagia. My primary diagnosis would be Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). Differential diagnoses could include other causes of pancytopenia such as aplastic anemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

-Topographic Diagnosis: The patient's illness seems to be primarily affecting her hematologic system, given the pancytopenia and schistocytes on peripheral smear. The esophagus is also affected, as evidenced by the dysphagia and esophageal inflammation. Differential diagnoses could include the gastrointestinal system (given the early satiety and weight loss) and the respiratory system (given the ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening on chest CT).

-Etiological Diagnosis: The cause of the patient's illness is not entirely clear. The presence of yeast consistent with Candida in the esophageal brushings suggests a possible fungal infection, but this may be a secondary finding rather than the primary cause of her symptoms. The patient's previous bone marrow biopsy showing loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and gain of chromosome 8 suggests a possible underlying hematologic malignancy, such as myelodysplastic syndrome. Differential diagnoses could include a bacterial infection (given the fever and chills) or a tick-borne illness (given the empirical treatment with doxycycline at the other hospital).

-Pathologic Diagnosis: The presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear, along with the patient's symptoms of fatigue, fever, and dysphagia, strongly suggest Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). TTP is a rare blood disorder characterized by the formation of small blood clots throughout the body, which can lead to serious health problems if not treated promptly. The clots can limit or block the flow of oxygen-rich blood to the body's organs, such as the brain, kidneys, and heart. The presence of schistocytes - fragmented red blood cells - is a hallmark of TTP and is indicative of the mechanical damage caused by these clots. 

The patient's pancytopenia (a reduction in the number of red and white blood cells, as well as platelets) and her symptoms of fatigue and lightheadedness are consistent with this diagnosis. The pancytopenia is likely due to the consumption of platelets in the clotting process and the destruction of red blood cells as they pass through the small vessels filled with clots. 

The patient's dysphagia and early satiety could be explained by the involvement of the gastrointestinal system in TTP. The formation of clots in the vessels supplying the esophagus and stomach could lead to inflammation and damage, resulting in these symptoms. 

The patient's fever could be a result of the systemic inflammation caused by the widespread clotting. Alternatively, it could be due to a secondary infection, as patients with TTP are at increased risk of infections due to the reduced number of white blood cells.

The patient's previous bone marrow biopsy showing loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and gain of chromosome 8 suggests a possible underlying hematologic malignancy, such as myelodysplastic syndrome. This could have predisposed the patient to developing TTP. 

In conclusion, based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings, I believe that TTP is the most likely diagnosis. However, further investigations, including ADAMTS13 activity (a specific enzyme deficiency associated with TTP), would be needed to confirm this diagnosis.

Infectionist-microbiologist (to chat_manager):

Possible microorganisms that may affect the patient:

1. Candida species: The patient's esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed yeast consistent with Candida. This could be causing the esophageal inflammation and dysphagia.

2. Tick-borne pathogens: The patient was empirically treated with doxycycline due to concerns about a possible tick-borne illness. This could include bacteria such as Borrelia burgdorferi (causes Lyme disease), Anaplasma phagocytophilum (causes anaplasmosis), or Babesia microti (causes babesiosis).

Elements in anamnesis that support microorganisms as the cause of the diseases:

1. Candida species: The patient's esophageal inflammation and dysphagia could be caused by a Candida infection. Candida is a common cause of esophagitis, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.

2. Tick-borne pathogens: The patient's fever, chills, and fatigue could be symptoms of a tick-borne illness. However, her blood tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis were negative.

Microorganisms that have more elements as the diagnosis:

1. Candida species: The patient's symptoms and the findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy strongly suggest a Candida infection. This is supported by the presence of yeast in the esophageal brushings.

2. Tick-borne pathogens: Although the patient was empirically treated for a possible tick-borne illness, her negative blood tests make this less likely.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms and findings are most consistent with a Candida infection of the esophagus. However, her pancytopenia and schistocytes on peripheral smear suggest a hematologic disorder, possibly Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP). Further testing, including ADAMTS13 activity, would be needed to confirm this diagnosis.

Concluder (to chat_manager):

The final diagnosis is Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (TTP) with a secondary Candida infection of the esophagus.

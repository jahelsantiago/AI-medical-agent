    An 80-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital because of pancytopenia and the identification of schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear.

Six weeks before admission to this hospital, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea developed, along with chills and subjective fever. The symptoms resolved after 4 days without specific intervention, but then intermittent dysphagia with solid foods and early satiety developed. During the next 4 weeks, the patient had gradually progressive fatigue and light-headedness. The fatigue progressed to the point that she could no longer stay at work for more than a few hours; she presented to another hospital for evaluation.

At the other hospital, the patient reported that she had ongoing fatigue and had lost 6 kg of weight over a 5-week period. On examination, the temperature was 38.9Â°C, the weight 55.5 kg, and the body-mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) 21.9. Laboratory studies revealed pancytopenia, and examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes. Blood levels of glucose and electrolytes were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests; other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1. Imaging studies were obtained.

Dr. Ranjodh S. Dhami: A chest radiograph was normal. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis, performed after the administration of intravenous and oral contrast material, revealed a small hiatal hernia, multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, and indeterminate bilateral pelvic masses measuring 4.8 cm in diameter on the right side and 6.3 cm in diameter on the left side (Figure 1).

Dr. Pappas: Intravenous fluids were administered, and the patient was admitted to the other hospital. On hospital day 2, the hemoglobin level decreased to 6.6 g per deciliter, and two units of packed red cells were transfused. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed diffuse esophageal inflammation with white exudates throughout the esophagus; examination of brushings revealed yeast consistent with candida, and treatment with fluconazole was initiated.

During the next 3 hospital days, the patient continued to feel unwell, with persistent fever and limited oral intake due to odynophagia, and the administration of intravenous fluids was continued. Blood and urine cultures showed no growth. On hospital day 5, empirical therapy with doxycycline was started because of concerns about a possible tickborne illness.

On hospital day 6, the oxygen saturation decreased to 89% while the patient was breathing ambient air and then increased to 94% when oxygen was delivered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 3 liters per minute. CT of the chest, performed after the administration of intravenous contrast material, revealed ground-glass opacities and interlobular septal thickening, findings consistent with pulmonary edema, along with bilateral pleural effusions of a small to moderate size. The administration of intravenous fluids was stopped, and one dose of intravenous furosemide was provided.

On hospital day 7, fever resolved but pancytopenia persisted. Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed a moderate amount of schistocytes, severe anisocytosis, large platelets, and an increased amount of bands without blasts. Direct and indirect Coombsâ€™ tests were negative, as were nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis. Blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, cobalamin, folate, homocysteine, and anticardiolipin IgG and IgM were normal, as were the results of kidney-function and liver-function tests. The results of serologic tests for Epsteinâ€“Barr virus were consistent with previous infection. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood showed phenotypically normal myeloid cells; there was an increased amount of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts, which accounted for less than 1% of leukocytes and were of unclear clinical significance.

A tunneled catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein, and plasma exchange was initiated for the treatment of possible thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). Total parenteral nutrition was also initiated, because oral intake was still limited by odynophagia.

On hospital day 8, oral intake of soft foods and liquids increased. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular size and function, as well as a mildly thickened aortic valve with no stenosis or regurgitation; there was trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. On hospital day 9, the patient underwent additional plasma exchange and was transferred to this hospital for further care.

On evaluation in this hospital, the patient reported that her energy level had increased. She recalled that she had felt mildly confused at the other hospital, but the confusion had since resolved. She had had no gum bleeding or blood in the stool or urine. Other medical history included hypertension and dyslipidemia. Surgical history included hysterectomy at 40 years of age, with no vaginal bleeding since the procedure.

One year earlier, routine laboratory testing had revealed mild thrombocytopenia and anemia. A bone marrow biopsy performed at that time had revealed slightly hypercellular marrow with maturing trilineage hematopoiesis but with some erythroid abnormalities and occasional hyperchromatic megakaryocytes; cytogenetic analysis had shown a loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and a gain of chromosome 8 in 65% of the cells. Thereafter, blood counts monitored every 4 months, including 4 months before this presentation, had remained stable; laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

Medications included amlodipine, atorvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. There were no known drug allergies. The patient drank alcohol occasionally and did not use illicit drugs. She had smoked tobacco for 50 years but had quit 5 years before this presentation. She was widowed and lived alone in New England; her work involved cleaning a church several days a week. Her sister had had breast cancer at 30 years of age, and a brother had had testicular cancer at a young age and liver cancer at 55 years of age.

On examination, the temperature was 36.8Â°C, the blood pressure 150/65 mm Hg, the pulse 72 beats per minute, the respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute, and the oxygen saturation 97% while oxygen was administered through a nasal cannula at a rate of 2 liters per minute. The patient was alert and oriented, and she did not appear ill. There were no petechiae. There was no bleeding at the site of tunneled catheter placement in the right internal jugular vein. The first and second heart sounds were normal; a grade 2/6 systolic murmur was heard at the left lower sternal border. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.

Examination of a peripheral-blood smear revealed schistocytes, anisocytosis, and a low platelet count, with large platelets present; the white cells appeared normal, and there were no blasts (Figure 2). The results of serum protein electrophoresis were normal. The levels of serum free kappa and lambda light chains were increased, with a normal ratio. Screening for human immunodeficiency virus infection was negative. Urinalysis showed 2+ urobilinogen, without bilirubin, blood, glucose, ketones, protein, or nitrates; the specific gravity and pH were normal. Consultation was obtained from the gynecology service regarding the bilateral pelvic masses noted on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Blood levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen were normal, and follow-up in the gynecology clinic was recommended for further evaluation after discharge. Other laboratory test results are shown in Table 1.

[33mInfectionist[0m (to chat_manager):

Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, there are several considerations to make. 

Syndromatic Diagnosis: The patient presents with pancytopenia, schistocytes on peripheral blood smear, and a history of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, chills, and fever. This suggests a systemic illness, possibly an infection or a hematological disorder. 

Topographic Diagnosis: The patient has multiple abnormalities in the blood, suggesting a hematological disorder. The presence of bilateral pelvic masses also suggests a possible gynecological disorder. 

Etiological Diagnosis: The presence of yeast consistent with candida in the esophagus suggests a possible fungal infection. However, the pancytopenia and schistocytes could also suggest a hematological disorder such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), as suggested by the other physicians. The presence of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts in the peripheral blood could also suggest a myeloproliferative disorder. 

Given the patient's age and the presence of multiple simple cysts in the right kidney, it's also important to consider the possibility of a malignancy. The bilateral pelvic masses could be ovarian in origin, and the patient's family history of breast and testicular cancer increases her risk of gynecological cancers. 

In terms of infectious diseases, the patient's symptoms and the presence of candida in the esophagus could suggest a systemic fungal infection. However, the negative blood and urine cultures make this less likely. The empirical therapy with doxycycline suggests a possible tickborne illness, but the negative nucleic acid tests for babesiosis and anaplasmosis make this less likely. 

In conclusion, this patient's presentation is complex and could suggest multiple possible diagnoses. Further investigation is needed to determine the exact cause of her symptoms.

[33mRheumatologist[0m (to chat_manager):

As a rheumatologist, I would like to add that the presence of schistocytes on a peripheral-blood smear, along with the patient's symptoms of fatigue, light-headedness, and fever, could suggest a microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). 

TTP is characterized by the pentad of thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, neurological symptoms, fever, and renal impairment. However, not all these features need to be present for the diagnosis. The negative Coombs' test and the presence of schistocytes on peripheral smear are consistent with MAHA. The patient's confusion could be a neurological manifestation of TTP. However, the normal kidney function tests argue against TTP or HUS.

Another consideration could be systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which can present with a variety of symptoms including fever, fatigue, and hematological abnormalities. However, the patient's age and the absence of other typical SLE symptoms make this less likely.

The presence of atypical CD34+ myeloblasts in the peripheral blood could suggest a myeloproliferative disorder, which can also cause pancytopenia and fatigue. The patient's previous bone marrow biopsy showing loss of chromosomes 3 and 5 and gain of chromosome 8 could be consistent with this.

The bilateral pelvic masses are concerning for a gynecological malignancy, which could potentially cause paraneoplastic syndromes leading to hematological abnormalities. However, the normal levels of CA 125, CA 19-9, and carcinoembryonic antigen argue against this.

In conclusion, this patient's presentation is complex and could be due to a variety of causes. Further investigation, including a repeat bone marrow biopsy and evaluation of the pelvic masses, is needed to clarify the diagnosis.
